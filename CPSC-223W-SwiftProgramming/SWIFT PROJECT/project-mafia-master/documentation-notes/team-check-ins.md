### Brian Lucero

Q1) Researched into the new game im supposed to implement and decided to use a simple 3 slidign bar emoji template for the slot machine game. I managed to find some on line sources that highlight the functionality i want and have since started to implement it. However, I did not meet the expectation of presenting a working game.   

Q2) i plan to immediately learn whatever it is i need to learn allowing me to finish the game in terms of our app, and connect to it the main project in github. Then i plan to try and get my slot machine to utilize various concepts used in class. and manage my teammates to be oriented on the same goal.   

Q3) def hit a snag when i was not sure on how to get my game to be connected to the main project. Wasnt sure which files the actual code and logic is supposed to be contained in.
