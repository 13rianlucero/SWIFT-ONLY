## 10/15/2020 notes during Zoom lecture meeting:
- We agreed on a general design for the project and pushed some of the starting code to the github master branch in the very beginning
- limited communication created a slow divided start to the project
- two main ways that the start of the project has been done:

1. Angel and brian worked on creating a game project from the swift templates. 
this way utilizes:
- the built in functions from swift
- spritekit
- gameplaykit (possibly in the future)
- already has a character animation
- has up and down character movement but not LF yet
- uses the directional arrow buttons on the screen to move the character

2. Fahad and brian worked on creating the project more from scratch
this way utilizes:
- more hands on, writing our own functions rather than the built in stuff from swift
- doesnt use any of the kits from swift
- has a square as the character animation
- tapping on certain part of the screen indicates where to the character will move
- character can move in any direction on the screen, basically just closes the gap/distance between the character and finger tap
- has no directional arrows

Discussed about the two different methods:
- agreed on moving forward with angel/brians version as the base project folder
- implemented the character movement functionality from fahad/brians version (touch on screen to move the character to that location of the screen)

Brainstorming on whetheror
1. to include the character feature still 
2. leave behind the character feature and focus more on having a main screen with different games to choose from
- after some conversation we decided to build both alongside each other. 
- the focus should be on making a game project (each of us make our own game to implement)

Moving forward:
1. each of us create our own game project file
- as soon as you create the starter file, commmit all the files to your github branch

2. 

However, we should focus more on building the
